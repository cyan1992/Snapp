This is a practice project designed similar to the Snapp.ir website. Elements, images, fonts, and other features have been loaded from the Snapp website. Therefore, you are not allowed to use these assets in any personal or commercial projects.

This project is simply an exercise using pure HTML and CSS.

This project is suitable for those who have just started front-end development. You are allowed to view the code and only use my codes.

Here's to good days ahead. Thank you.
